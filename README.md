## Development

Generate the Cloudflare D1 schema:

```sh
npm run migrate:local
```

Run the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh
npm run typegen
```

You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

## Deployment

Generate the Cloudflare D1 schema:

```sh
npm run generate
npm run migrate:remote
```

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
# Unused: For using Workers' CI/CD
npm run deploy
```
